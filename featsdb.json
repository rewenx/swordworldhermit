Moroi: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume gaseous form, it transforms with you and follows you; its transformation ends when yours does.

You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll's immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types. Embalmed Form: This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an alter self spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll. Enduring Dust: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed. Positive Energy Immunity: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands. Spell Immunity: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using spell immunity. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new spell immunity prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as greater spell immunity. Creating this type of prayer scroll costs 100 gp x the spell level of the spell keyed to the scroll.",

   "benefit": "If you are struck by a melee weapon you can try to convert some or all of that damage into movement that sends you off in an uncontrolled bouncing roll. To do so, you must make an Acrobatics check (DC = 5 + the damage dealt from the attack) as an immediate action. If you succeed in this check, you take no damage from the actual attack but instead convert that damage into movement with each point equating to 1 foot of movement. For example, if you would have taken 6 points of damage, you would convert that into 6 feet of movement. You immediately move in a straight line in a direction of your choice this number of feet (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot-square), halting if you reach a distance equal to your actual speed. If this movement would make you strike an object or creature of your size or larger, the movement immediately ends, you take 1d4 points of damage, and fall prone in that square. This involuntary movement provokes attacks of opportunity normally if you move through threatened squares, but does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature that struck you in the first place. You are staggered for 1 round after you attempt to use this feat, whether or not you succeed.",

If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level.

A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots. Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of dispel magic. The spell erase can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to erase the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity.

   "prerequisites": "Base attack bonus +1, Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks.",
   "prerequisite_feats": "",
   "benefit": "In addition to holy water's normal uses, you can use holy water to create a variety of other effects, which are listed below. To use holy water in a particular way, you must meet the additional requirements of that effect, such as a particular feat, ranks in a specific skill, or the ability to cast a certain spell (specified after the effect's name). Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water. Blinding Water (Improved Precise Shot): By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Ref lex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don't rely on vision. Concentrate Holy Water (Craft [alchemy] 4 ranks): Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperpotent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks of holy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 x the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy). A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage x the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage x the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target. Healing Glyph (ability to cast glyph of warding): You can replace the diamond material component in a glyph of warding spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, you must place a spell glyph containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead. Healing Water (Heal 5 ranks): You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage. Holy Circle (ability to cast magic circle against evil): You can replace the silver material component of a magic circle against evil spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20. Holy Water Splash (Point-Blank Shot): When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase the damage dealt to creatures within the splash radius of holy water, such as the concentrate holy water ability of this feat or the empower holy water spell on page 26.",

   "prerequisite_feats": "Spell Focus (divination)",
   "benefit": "Immediately before casting a spell, as a swift action, you can attempt to augment a spell's casting using Arithmancy. To do so, determine the digital root of the name of the spell you are casting. To find the digital root of a spell name, first assign a numerical value to each letter of the name, per the Letter Values table. Once you have a string of digits, sum them. If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root. Once you've translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at -1 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell's name when determining the spell's digital root, but they increase the spell's level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess. For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented fireball. First, he translates the spell name into numbers. Fireball translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of fireball is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [fireball's spell level] + 2 [fireball's digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the fireball this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast fireball and perform another action, though he expends the spell.",

   "benefit": "When you take this feat, select two metamagic feats you do not yet have. When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the Core Rulebook); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability. When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell's effective spell level. Refer to the Prime Constants table to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot. For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the magic missile he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [magic missile's base level] = 4, so the spell's effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41. Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 x 6) + (4 - 3) x 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] x 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged magic missile takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants. His attempt would have been unsuccessful, and he would have expended a full-round action and his prepared 1st-level magic missile spell with no effect.",

A spellcaster with this feat can enhance a deck of cards as though it were a ranged weapon with 54 pieces of ammunition. This enhancement functions only when used in tandem with this feat, and has no affect on any other way the cards might be used. Only a character who possesses this feat can use an enhanced deck of cards; she must still use the Arcane Strike feat to activate the cards' enhancement.",

   "prerequisites": "Caster level 1st.",
   "prerequisite_feats": "",
   "benefit": "You and an ally within 30 feet who shares this feat can cast your spells together to create a more powerful, hybrid effect. Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]) . Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions. When the spells to be commixed are cast, one is designated as the primary spell (typically the higherlevel spell), while the other is the secondary spell. The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells' descriptors. Targeted creatures can attempt a saving throw against the primary spell as normal (assuming that a save is normally allowed), and then attempt a separate save against the secondary effect. The secondary effect's save type is described in its listing, and its save DC is equal to the normal save DC of the primary or secondary spell, whichever is lower (or, if neither spell allows a saving throw, 10 + lowest spell's level + spellcaster's primary spellcasting ability score [Int, Wis, or Cha] modifier). Commixed spells cannot be counterspelled normally. A creature with Improved Counterspell can counterspell commixed spells if both spells are correctly identified and both belong to the same school. Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled. Spell resistance still applies to the secondary effect, unless both of the commixed spells bypass spell resistance. Synergistic Benefits: The primary spell's save DC (if any) increases by 1. If either spell is normally modified by Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus, the bonus to save DCs granted by those feats stacks with this increase. The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance. Secondary Effects: While the secondary spell has no direct effect other than bolstering the effects of the primary spell, the combination of spells also creates a unique secondary effect depending on the elemental descriptors of the commixed spells. For the purpose of this secondary effect, the acid, cold, and electricity descriptors count as earth, water, and air descriptors, respectively. Commixed spells with the same elemental descriptors do not produce a secondary effect, though the primary spell still gains the synergistic benefits described above. &#8226; Dust (Air/Earth): Choked by dust, the targets must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. Targeted spellcasters must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (the DC is equal to the save DC). On a successful save, the targets are not staggered but must still attempt concentration checks. &#8226; Lava (Earth/Fire): The targets are splattered with bits of molten rock and take 1d6 points of fire damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire (see Catching on Fire on page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). &#8226; Mud (Earth/Water): The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone and have their movement speeds cut in half (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. On a successful save, the targets' movement speeds are cut in half for 1 round. &#8226; Smoke (Air/Fire): The targets suffer smoke inhalation and must succeed at Fortitude saves or become nauseated for 1 round and blinded for 1d4 rounds. Success negates the nausea effect and reduces the blindness to 1 round. Creatures immune to fire are immune to the nausea effect. &#8226; Snow (Air/Water): The primary spell gains the cold descriptor if it doesn't have that descriptor already, and half the damage dealt (if any) is cold damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. &#8226; Steam (Fire/Water): Damage caused by the primary spell (if any) is treated as nonlethal, untyped damage (neither cold nor fire damage) and is not affected by energy resistance or absorbed by protection from energy. The targets become blinded for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Will save.",

Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process. Shadow piercings must be placed in a part of the body normally associated with a magic item slot, but they do not take up a slot on the body, nor interfere with other magic items that use those slots. A single slot can only hold one shadow piercing (nonmagical piercings do not count against this limit). Shadow piercings can be applied to the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, and wrist. A single slot can hold multiple physical piercings, though the pieces of jewelry operate as a single item and must be created for that purpose. Shadow piercings have different levels of power: minor, major, and greater. Minor shadow piercings usually include one piece of jewelry, while major and greater shadow piercings often are made up of multiple rings and spikes that cover the entire area of the piercing's slot (but are still considered a single item). A creature can only use a number of shadow piercings equal its Constitution modifier plus its Wisdom modifier. Carefully inserting or removing a shadow piercing takes a full-round action and deals no damage. Alternatively, a shadow piercing may be pulled out of a creature using the steal maneuver as a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage. Only a creature with the Craft Shadow Piercing feat may create or insert a shadow piercing, but any creature may remove one. Inserting a shadow piercing is impossible unless the target is willing or helpless. After being removed, a shadow piercing may be inserted into another creature by someone with this feat. Since they are treated as magic items, they are affected by dispel magic. Shadow piercings follow the rules for magic item creation, except the creator can use the Craft (jewelry) skill instead of Spellcraft. New shadow piercings can be researched and designed using the rules for pricing new magic items. Shadow piercing powers for a specific slot must be thematically similar or linked. Since shadow piercings don't interfere with other magic items in the same slot, but can only have one piercing per slot, the base price is multiplied by 1.5 instead of doubled as if they had no space limitation.",

One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast).

The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided.

The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing. If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing. Since you are concealing the spell's manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you're doing something, even if they don't realize you're casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your loud, clear voice but don't notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can't use readied actions that depend on realizing that you're casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you're casting. Spells such as fireball that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you. If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you're behaving unusually.",

If he fails, he becomes plagued by self-doubt and second-guesses himself. For his next two attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or ability checks, he rolls twice and takes the lower result; for every 5 ranks of Bluff you possess beyond 5, this ability affects an additional roll. This is a mind-affecting effect, and it doesn't work if the target is immune to curses. Once you attempt to feign putting a curse on a creature, you cannot do so again against the same creature for 24 hours, and if the target succeeds at detecting your ruse, he gains a +10 bonus against future attempts.",

This attack can be delivered via touch or a ray, as a standard action. A melee symbolic bolt requires a melee touch attack that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and a ranged symbolic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A symbolic bolt deals damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in the Use Magic Device skill. You choose the type of damage dealt by your symbolic bolt each time you use this feat from those offered by the cleric domains granted by the deity whose holy symbol you use. The types of damage (and the cleric domains that grant them) are acid (Earth, Magic, Rune), cold (Darkness, Magic, Rune, Void, Water, Weather), electricity (Air, Magic, Rune, Weather), fire (Destruction, Fire, Magic, Rune), negative energy (Death, Destruction, Void), positive energy (Glory, Healing, Repose, Sun), sonic (Magic, Rune, Weather), and untyped (any). If a symbolic bolt is used to deal untyped damage, the bolt's damage is reduced to an amount equal to 1d3 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in Use Magic Device. When you create a symbolic bolt, it originates from the hand holding the holy symbol and appears only briefly, so you have a hand free anytime you're not attacking with a symbolic bolt. The feat Weapon Focus (ray) doesn't apply to symbolic bolts, but you can take the feat Weapon Focus (symbolic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged symbolic bolts. Spells that target a single weapon (such as magic weapon) can't affect symbolic bolts, nor can a symbolic bolt have magic weapon special abilities.

The animal rises from death in 1d4 days as a vampiric animal bonded with the vampire who spawned it. Thereafter, the vampiric animal advances in abilities like a normal animal companion as the vampire gains further class levels in the class that granted the animal companion. In order to gain a dire rat as a vampiric companion, a vampire's effective druid level must be 4th. To gain a wolf as an vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 6th. To gain a dire bat vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 9th.

Vampiric animal companions count toward the total number of Hit Dice a vampire may enslave, as well as toward the limit of animal companions the character may have at any one time.

If the creature is attempting to conceal its loyalties, it attempts a Bluff check. If the result of the Bluff check is higher than 20, that result becomes the DC of your Sense Motive check. On a success, you learn whether the creature has a patron god, a witch patron, or a government to which it is strongly loyal. You can attempt to name one specific god, patron, or government for every 2 ranks you have in Sense Motive by introducing them into the conversation as subjects, as noted below. You can use this ability only if you observe the creature in an environment where loyalty to a god, government, leader, or patron is being discussed. If this isn't already occurring, you can introduce the topic, but doing so may expose your interest. In this case, the creature you are observing and any other creatures able to hear you bring up the topic of loyalty to a god, government, leader, or patron can attempt Sense Motive checks (opposed by a Bluff check from you, which the GM rolls in secret). On a success, the creature realizes you are interested in determining the observed creature's specific loyalty. If you are attempting to determine whether the observed creature's loyalty is to a specific god, government, or leader as noted above, creatures who succeed at the Sense Motive check are aware of the specific god, government, leader, or patron about which you are interesting in learning.",

You must have access to an alchemist's lab (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76) in order to extract components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these components within 10 minutes of the haunt or creature's death or destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you. Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature). Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted. Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell's normal material components.

If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further.

Due to the dilution, a murky spell has only one-tenth of the duration of a normal spell (generally 1 minute per level, though mind fog lasts 3 minutes), but this reduction doesn't affect the duration of secondary effects like mind fog's mental penalties. Abilities that see through mist and fog can't see through a murky spell unless they also specifically see through murky water (like the mistsight universal monster rule).

   "prerequisite_feats": "",
   "benefit": "When you take this feat, you eschew all of your former identities, going as far as to render your former name completely inaccessible to discover by mortal means. You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places. (For example, you could adopt the title \"Blue Fox\" or \"Twilight Stalker,\" but not the title \"Chelish Avenger\" or \"Spirit of the Mwangi.\") At the ritual's conclusion, you must don the mask created for the ritual, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally. As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you in relation to of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC of 10 + your Hit Dice. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the named bulletUC spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this feat's benefits are not magical for the purpose of dispel magic and other effects). In addition, you cannot attempt to impersonate a specific individual by any means, magical or nonmagical. If you ever reveal or confirm your connection to your eschewed identities, you immediately lose the benefit of this feat and gain 1d4 permanent negative levels as your discarded identities return. You cannot regain the benefit of this feat or remove these negative levels until you atone (as per atonement, as if restoring a class feature).",

You also gain an additional benefit depending on which family you belong to. Basri: You come from the long line of ambassadors, diplomats, and travelers that make up the Basri, and your family maintains the strongest ties to the elven nation of Kyonin of any Taldan humans. Select one of the following as a bonus starting language: Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Sylvan. You gain proficiency in one of the following weapons: longbow (including composite), longsword, rapier, or shortbow (including composite). If you gain proficiency in all martial weapons at 1st level, you can instead select elven curve blade. Clement: Your Garundi and Mwangi ancestors served Taldor proudly during the Sixth Army of Exploration and were awarded titles for their service. Your family, which has maintained their noble titles to this day, is known for keen insights and biting observations. You can substitute your Wisdom modifier for your Charisma modifier when attempting Diplomacy skill checks. Corcina: Your family came to prominence during the Second Army of Exploration, and maintains a legacy as explorers and sailors. You gain a +1 bonus on Climb and Escape Artist checks, and a +2 bonus on Survival checks to navigate. Karthis: Yours is a family of distinguished military veterans, charismatic demagogues, and xenophobic zealots. As the rest of the family becomes increasingly Imperialist, you have made no effort to remain in their good graces, but you retain the skills they taught you during a childhood of rigorous training. You can apply your Charisma modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to Initiative checks. Kastner: Your stalwart family defines itself by opposing your devil-worshiping Chelish cousins, a grudge that inspired some of Taldor's greatest healers, priests, and negotiators. You gain one additional use per day of channel energy, lay on hands, or mesmerist tricks, or 3 additional rounds of bardic music per day. You gain only one of these benefits, even if you later acquire a second class that provides one of the other class features listed. Lotheed: Your family ranks include the greatest wizards and arcane scholars in Taldor, and schooling in some of the most comprehensive arcane libraries in the Inner Sea was your birthright. If your Intelligence is 11 or higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day-dancing lights, prestidigitation, read magic, unseen servant. The caster level for these effects is equal to one-half your class level. Merosett: The cunning members of your large family, a longtime fixture in Oppara's bureaucracy, specialize in tracking lineages and sidestepping red tape. You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages and Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages. You halve the time required to search through archives, navigate government offices, review contracts, or otherwise work with the complex bureaucracies your family has mastered for generations. Stavian: As a close relative of the Grand Prince, yours has been a life of material comfort and indulgence, colored by constant threats and direct influence. You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and on Will saves against enchantment spells of the charm and compulsion subschools. Talbot: Your starkly conservative family are merchants and entrepreneurs first and aristocrats second, willing to forgo duty if they can instead pursue profit. They condemn would-be adventurers and readily oust them from the family ranks, leaving you an outcast. You gain a +2 bonus on one Profession skill of your choice. Once per day, you can use this Profession skill in place of a single Knowledge skill check. Varima: Your family immigrated to Taldor from Vudra hundreds of years ago, and thanks to noble roots, extensive trade contacts, and an unparalleled skill in negotiation, soon developed into a steadfast fixture of Oppara's social scene. Whenever you use Diplomacy to influence a crowd or a room (but not individuals), you can roll twice and use the better result. Vernisant: Your family is descended from the great general Arnisant, who commanded Taldan forces during the Shining Crusade... and they will never let anyone forget it! Their fierce Imperialist support and nationalist fervor has left you alienated from your relatives now, but their emphasis on scholarship left a mark nonetheless. You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skills in which you have at least 1 rank. Vinmark: Newcomers and outsiders, your Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted your family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard. Established aristocrats consider your family crude, choosing to leave them on the margins of Taldan politics unless a noble thinks they could use you to curry favor with the Grand Prince, but hard-won practicality and newborn cynicism grant you insight most Taldan nobles lack. Once per day when rolling a Sense Motive check, you may roll two dice and use the better result. Zespire: Your family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Perform checks when dealing with common citizens and with nobles whose titles are limited to Lord, Lady, Knight, or Dame.",

The soul can be captured in any way (the spells create soul gem, soul trap, and trap the soul are the most common methods), but you must be able to touch the soul or the object in which it is trapped (usually a crystal or gem) to use it as a material component. Using a soul in this way does not harm the object in which it was trapped. The soul itself must be at least equal in value to the gp cost of the material component you are replacing (any excess gp value is lost). See the sidebar on page 191 for the gp values of various souls. A soul used as a material component is damaged but not destroyed. Once used, such a soul is no longer trapped and cannot be used as a material component again. A creature whose soul has been used as a material component cannot be restored to life via raise dead. Reincarnate, resurrection, and true resurrection can restore such a creature to life if the caster succeeds at a DC 20 caster level check. Miracle and wish can restore the creature to life without requiring a caster level check. Using Soul-Powered Magic is an evil act.",
